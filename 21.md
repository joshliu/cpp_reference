# Problem 21 - The copier is broken.

How do copies and moves interact with inheritance?

Copy constructor: `Text::Text(const Text &other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} {}`

Move constructor: `Text::Text(Text &&other): Book{std::move(other)}, topic{std::move(other.topic)} {}`

Copy/Move assignment:
```c++
Text &Text::operator=(Text other) {
  Book::operator=(std::move(other));
  topic = std::move(other.topic);
}
```

But consider:
```c++
Book *b1 = new Text{...}, *b2 = new Text{...};
*b1 = *b2;
```
What happens? - only the Book part is copied - partial assignment
- topic doesn't match the title and author, object is corrupted.

Possible solution- Make operator= virtual
```c++
class Book {
  ...
  public:
    virtual Book *operator=(const Book &other);
};

class Text: public Book {
  ...
  public:
    // Text &operator=(const Text &other) override;
    Text &operator=(const Book &other) override; // must take a Book or its not an override.
};
```
- This doesn't compile

Another solution: Make all superclasses abstract.

Old:
```
   [Book]
    /   \
[Text] [Comic]
```
Instead:
```
    [Abstract Book]
     /     |     \
 [Book] [Text] [Comic]
```

```c++
class AbstractBook {
  ...
  protected:
    AbstractBook &operator=(AbstractBook other) {...} // non virtual

};

class Text: public AbstractBook {
  public:
    Text &operator=(Text other) {
      AbstractBook::operator=(std::move(other));
      topic = std::move(other.topic);
    }
    // operator= non virtual, therefore no mixed assignment
};
```
`AbstractBook::operator=` not accessibile to outsiders, therefore `*b1 = *b2` won't compile.
