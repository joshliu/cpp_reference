# Problem 22 - I want to know what kind of Book I have
For simplicity: Assume:
```
   [Book]
    /   \
[Text] [Comic]
```

The C++ casting operators - 4 operators.

C style casting: `(type) expr`
- forces expr to be treated as type "type"
- e.g. 
```c++
int *p;
int q = (int) p;
```

1. static_cast - for conversions with a well-defined semantics
- e.g.
```c++
void f(int a); void f(double d);
int x;
f(static_cast<double>(x));
```
e.g. superclass pointer to subclass pointer
```c++
Book *b = new Text {...};
Text *t = static_cast<Text*>(b);
```
- You have to know that b really points to a Text, otherwise undefined behavior.

2. reinterpret_cast - for casts without a well-defined semantics
- unsafe, inplementation-dependent
```c++
Book *b = new Book {...};
int *p = reinterpret_cast<int*>(b);
```

3. const_cast
- for adding and removing const
- the only C++ cast that can "cast away const"
```c++
void g(Book &b); // assume we know g won't change b
f(const Book &b) {
  g(const_cast<Book&>(b));
}
```

4. dynamic_cast
- What if we don't know whether pb poitns at a Text?
```c++
Book *pb = ...
Text *pt = dynamic_cast<Text*>(pb);
// if *pb is a Text or a subclass of text, then cast succeeds, pt points at the object
// else, pt = nullptr;
```
e.g.
```c++
void whatIsIt(Book *pb) {
    if (dynamic_cast<Text*>(pb)) cout << "Text";
    else if (dynamic_cast<Comic*>(pb)) cout << "Comic";
    else cout << "Book";
}
```
- not good style - when you create a new book type the function has to be changed.

Dynamic reference casting:
```c++
Book *pb = ...;
Text &t = dynamic_cast<Text&>(*pb);
// If *pb is a Text - ok
// else, raises std::bad_cast
```

Dynamic Casting works by accessing an object's Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)
- this is stored in the vtable for the class
- therefore, can only dynamic_cast on objects with at least one virtual method.

Dynamic Reference Casting offers a possible solution to the polymorphic assignment problem.
```c++
Text &Text::operator=(Book other) {
  Text &textother = dynamic_cast<Text&>(other); // throws if other is not a Text
  if (this == &textother) return *this;
  Book::operator=(std::move(textother));
  topic=std::move(textother.topic);
  return *this;
}
```
