# Problem 20 - I want a class with no objects
```c++
class Student {
 public:
  virtual float fees() const;
};

class RegularStudent: public Student {
 public:
  Float fees() const override; // regular student fees.
};

class CoOpStudent: public Student {
 public:
  Float fees() const override; // co-op student fees
}
```

What should student::fees do?

Don't know - every student should be Regular or Co-op.

Solution: explicitly give `Student::fees` no implementation.
```c++
class Student { // called an abstract class
 public:
  virtual float fees() const = 0; // called a pure virtual method
};
```
Abstract classes cannot be instatiated.
```c++
Student s;
Student *s = new Student;
```
Can point to instances of concrete classes.
```c++
Student *s = new RegularStudent;
```

Subclasses of abstract classes are abstract, unless they implement all of the pure virtual methods.

Abstract classes 
- used to organize concrete classes
- can contain common fields, methods, default implementation.
