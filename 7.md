Problem 7: Tampering
====================

```c++
vector v;
v.cap = 100;		// sets cap without allocating memory
v.push_back(1);
v.push_back(10);
...

// Undefinied behavior, will likely crash.
```

Interfereing with ADTs
1. Forgery: create an object without using a constructor (impossible now)
2. Tampering: accessing internals without using provided interface methods

What's the big deal? Invariants.

<u>Invariants</u> are statements that will always be true about abstractions.

ADT's provide and rely on invariants.
- stacks: provide the invariant that the last item pushed is the first popped off.
- vectors: rely on the invariant that elements 0,...,cap-1 denote valid locations.

Cannot guarantee invariants if the user can interfere.
This makes the program hard to reason about.

Fix: <u>encapsulation</u> - seal objects into "black boxes"
```c++
struct vector {
	private:
		size_t n, cap;
		int *theVector;
		// fields are only accessible within the vector class
	public:
		vector();
		size_t size() const;
		int push_back(int n);
		// visible to all
};
```
- If no access specifier is given, then that means public.


vector.cc:
```
#include <vector.h>

namespace {
	void increaseCap(vector &v) {

	}
}
```
- increaseCap doesn't work anymore. Doesn't have access to cap and theVector.

### Try again:
vector.h:
```c++
struct vector {
	private:
		...
	public:
		...
	private:
		void increaseCap(); // Now a private method.
};
```

vector.cc:
```c++
#include <vector.h>

namespace CS246E {
vector::vector() { ... }
// rest as before

void vector::increaseCap() {
	...
}
}
```
- no more anonymous namespace



- structs - default public access
- classes - default private access

classes and structs in c++ are the same, but classes are private by default!

vector.h:
```c++
class vector {
	size_t n, cap;
	int *theVector;

	public:
		vector();
		...

	private:
		void increaseCap();
};
```

vector.cc: no change.

A problem with linked lists:

```c++
Node n {3, nullptr};
Node m {4, &n}; 
// when m's destructor runs, it will try to delete &n, which is on the stack
```
- There was an invariant - next is nullptr, or was allocated by new

How can we enforce this? Encapsulate node inside a wrapper class.

```c++
class list {
	struct Node {	// private nested class, not available outside of list
		int data;
		Node *next; 

		// ... methods
	}

	Node *theList;
	size_t size;
	public:
		list(): theList{nullptr} {}
		~list() { delete theList; }
		size_t size() const;
		void push_front(int n) {
			theList = new Node{n, theList};
		}
		void pop_front() {
			if (theList) {
				node *temp = theList;
				theList = theList->next;
				temp->next = nullptr;
				delete temp;
			}
		}
		const int &operator[](size_t i) const {
			Node *cur = theList;
			for (size_t j = 0; j<i && cur, ++j, cur = cur->next);
			return cur->data;
		}
		int &operator[](size_t i) { ... }
};
```
- Client cannot manipulate the list directly.
- no access to next pointers, invariant is maintained
