Problem 17 - Abstraction over Containers
========================================
Recall: map from Racket

```racket
(map f (list a b c)) ; -> (list (f a) (f b) (f c))
```

May want to do the same with vectors.

Assume: target has enough space to hold as much of source as we want to send.

```c++
template <typename T1, typename T2>
void transform(const vector<T1> &source, const vector<T2> &target, T2(*f)(T1)) {
	auto it = target.begin();
	for (auto &x: source) {
		*it = f(x);
		++it;
	}
}
```

OK, but 
- what if we only want part of the source?
- what if we want to send the source to the middle of target?

More general: use iterators.
```c++
template <typename T1, typename T2>
void transform(vector<T1>::iterator start, vector<T1>::iterator finish, vector<T2>::iterator target, T2(*f)(T1)) {
	while (start!= finish) {
		*target = f(*start);
		++start;
		++target;
	}
}
```
- this wont compile lol

Ok, but:
- If I want to transform a list, I'll write the same code again.
- What if I want to transform a list into a vector, or vice versa:
- Make the types stand for the iterators, not the container elements.
- But then how do we indicate the type for f?

```c++
template <typename InIter, typename OutIter, typename Fn>
void transform(InIter start, InIter finish, OutIter target, Fn f) {
	while (start!= finish) {
		*target = f(*start);
		++start;
		++target;
	}
}
```

Works over vector iterators, list iterators, or any other kinds of iterators.

InIter/OutIter can be any types that support `++, *, !=`, including ordinary pointers.

C++ will instatiate a template function with any type that has the operations being used by the function.

Function can be any type that supports function application.
```
class Plus {
	int n;
public:
	Plus(int n): n {n} {}
	int operator() (int m) { return n+m; }
};

Plus p{5};
cout << p(7); // 12
```
- p is called a *function object*

More interesting:
```c++
transform(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), Plus{1});
// or
transform(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), [](int n) {return n+1;});
// "lambda"
```

# Lambda!!!!!!!!!!!
```
			param list
			   |
lambda: [...](...) mutable? noexcept? {...}
		  |							 |
		capture list				   body
```
Semantics:
```c++
void f(T1 a, T2 b) {
	[a, &b](int x) {body}
}
```
translated to:
```c++
void f (T1 a, T2 b) {
	class haha {
		T1 a;
		T2 &b;
	public:
		haha(T1 a, T2 &b): a{a}, b{b} {}
		auto operator()(int x) const {
			body;
		}
	};
}
```
- Creates an anonymous class: lambda has a type, we cannot access the name.
- operator() is a const method, so it cannot change the field.

If the lambda is declared mutable, then operator() is not const.
- capture list: provides access to selected variables in the enclosing scope.
