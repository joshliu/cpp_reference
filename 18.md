Problem 18 - Heterogeneous Data
===============================
I want a mixture of types in my vector >:(
- Can't do this with a template.

e.g.
```c++
vector <template <typename T> T> v;
// lol not allowed, templates are compile-time entities
```

e.g. fields of a struct
```c++
class MediaPlayer {
	template<typename T> T nowPlaying;
};
```

**What's available in C:**
- unions:
	```c++
	union Media {song s; Movie m;};
	Media nowPlaying;
	```
	- stores one or the other
	- but how do you know which one it is?
- void\* :
	- `void *nowPlaying;`
- These are not type-safe.


**Items in a heterogeneous collection usually have something in common, e.g. provide a common interface.**
- Can be viewed as different kinds of a more general "thing", so have a vector of "things" or a field of type "thing."

### We'll use the standard CS246 example:
```c++
class Book {
	string title, author;
	int length;
public:
	Book(string title, string author, int length): 
		title{title}, author{author}, length{length} {}
	bool isHeavy() const { return length > 100; }
	string getTitle() const { return title; }
	// etc.
};
```

```
Book:
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+
```

```c++
class Text: public Book {
	string topic:
public:
	Text(string title, string author, int length, string topic):
		Book{title,author,length}, topic{topic} {}
	bool isHeavy() const { return length > 500; }
	string getTopic() const { return topic; }
};
```

```
Text:
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+
| topic      |
+------------+
```

```c++
class Comic: public Book {
	string hero;
public:
	comic(string title, string author, int length, string hero):
		Book{title,author,length}, topic{topic} {}
	bool isHeavy() const { return length > 50; }
	string getHero() const { return hero; }
};
```

```
Comic:
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+
| hero       |
+------------+
```

Subclasses inherit all members (fields and methods) from their superclass.
All three classes have fields: title, author, length, and methods getTitle, getAuthor, getLength, isHeavy.
...except that this doesnt work
```c++
bool Text::isHeavy() const {return length > 500;}
// length is private in Book, text cannot access it.
```

2 options:
1. 
```c++
class Book{
	string title, author;
protected:
	int length; // accessible only to this class and its subclasses.
public:
	...
};
```

2. 
```c++
bool Text::isHeavy() const {return getLength() > 500; }
// call public method.
```

Recommended to use option 2: 
- You have no control over what subclasses might do.
- protected weakens encapsulation; cannot enforce invariants on protected fields.

If you want subclasses to have privileged access:
- keep the fields private
- provide protected __get__ and __set__ methods.

Updated object creation/destruction protocols
### Creation Protocol:
1. Space is allocated
2. Superclass part is constructed
3. Fields constructed in declaration order
4. Constructor body runs

### Destruction Protocol:
1. Destructor body runs
2. Fields destructed in reverse declaration order
3. Superclass part is destructed
4. Space is deallocated

Must revisit everything we know to see the effect of inheritance.

Type compatibility 
- Texts and Comics are special kinds of books.
- They should be usable in place of Books.
```c++
Book b = Comic{"Spoderman", "Stan Lee", 75, "Spiderman"};
b.isHeavy();	// false. 75 is a heavy comic, but not a heavy book.
```
If b is a Comic, why is it acting like a Book?
- Because b is a book.

Consequence of **stack-allocated** objects:
```
Book b - sets aside enough space to hold a Book.
+------+
|      |
+------+
|      |
+------+
|      |
+------+

Comic {...} - doesn't fit into the book sized hole.
+------+
|      |
+------+
|      |
+------+
|      |
+------+
|      |
+------+
```
- Keeps only the book part - the comic part is chopped off.
- This is known as **slicing.**
- So it really is just a Book now, therefore `Book::isHeavy` runs.
- Slicing happens even if superclass and subclass are the same size.

Similarly, if you want to collect your books:
```c++
vector <Book> library;
library.push_back(Comic{...});
```
- only the book parts will be pushed - not a heterogeneous collection.

Also note:
```c++
void f(Book books[]); // Raw array
Comic comics[] = {...};
f(comics);
```
- Will compile, but never do this! Undefined behavior.
- array will be misaligned, and will not act like an array of books.

Slicing does not happen through pointers. However:
```c++
Book *p = new Comic{"Spoderman", "Stan Lee", 75, "Spiderman"};
p->isHeavy(); // still false!
```
- the choice of which isHeavy to run is based on the type of the pointer (static type), not the type of the object (dynamic type).
- Why? Cheaper. C++ Design Principle: if you don't use you, you shouldn't have to pay for it.

i.e. if you want something more expensive, you have to ask for it.
To make \*p act like a Comic when it is a Comic:
```c++
class Book {
	...
public:
	...
	virtual bool isHeavy() const {...};
};

class Comic: public Book {
	...
public:
	...
	bool isHeavy() const override {...};
};

p->isHeavy(); // true!!!!
```

Assume isHeavy is virtual.

Can now have a truly heterogeneous colection.
```c++
vector<Book*> library;
library.push_back(new Book{...});
library.push_back(new Comic{...});
```

even better: `vector<unique_ptr<Book>> library;`

Now we can do this:
```c++
int howManyHeavy(const vector<Book*>&v) {
	int count = 0;
	for (auto &b:v) {
		if (b->isHeavy()) ++count;
	}
	return count;
}
```
- correct version of isHeavy always chosen, even though we don't know what's in the vector, and the items are probably not the same type.
- polymorphism

```c++
for (auto &b:library) delete b; // not necessary if library is a vector of unique_ptrs
```
How do virtual methods work and why are they more expensive?
- Implementation-dependent, but the following is typical:

```
Book b1;
+------------+
| vptr       | // points at book vtable.
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+

Book b2;
+------------+
| vptr       | // points at book vtable.
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+

comic c;
+------------+
| vptr       | // points at comic vtable.
+------------+
| title      |
+------------+
| author     |
+------------+
| length     |
+------------+
| hero       |
+------------+


// Vtables: virtual methods only (decided at runtime)
+------------+
| "Book"     |
+------------+
| isHeavy    | // points at Book::isHeavy
+------------+

+------------+
| "Comic"    |
+------------+
| isHeavy    | // points at Comic::isHeavy
+------------+
```

Non-virtual methods - ordinary function calls.

If there is at least one virtual method 
- compiler creates a table of function pointers
	- one per class
	- called the vtable
- each object cointains a pointer to its class's vtable - the vptr.
- calling the virtual method: 
	- follow the vptr to the vtable
	- follow the function pointer to the correct function.

vptr is often the first field:
- so that a subclass object still looks like a superclass object
- so the program knows where the vptr is
- so virtual methods incur a cost in time (extra pointer dereferences) and space (each object gets a vptr)
- if a subclass doesn't override a virtual method, its vtable will point to the superclass implementation.
