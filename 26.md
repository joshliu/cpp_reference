# Problem 26: Collecting Stats
I want to know how many Students I create.

```
class Student {
    int assns, mt, final;
    static int count; // static - associated with the class, not one per object
  public:
    student(...) { ++count; }
    // accessors
    static int getCount() {return count;} 
    // static method - have no "this" param, not really methods, scoped functions.
}
```

.cc:
```c++
int Student::count = 0; // must define the var
Student s1{...}, s2{...}, s3{...};
cout << Student::getCount() << endl; // no receiver obj.
```

Now I want to count objects in other classes. How do we abstract this solution into reusable code?

```c++
template <typename T> struct Count {
    static int count;
    Count() {++count;}
    Count(const Count &) {++count;}
    Count(Count &&) {++ count;}
    ~Count(){--count;}
    public:
    static int getCount() {return count;}
}

template <typename T> int Count<T>::count = 0;


// private inheritance
// inherits count's impl, without creating an is_a relationship
// members of Count become private in Student.
class Student: Count<Student> {
    int assns, mt, final;
    public:
    Student(...): .... {}
    // accessors
    using Count<Student>::getCount; // makes Count::getCount visible.
};

class Book: Count<Book> {
    ...
    public:
    using Count<Book>::getCount;
};

```
Why is Count a template?
- So that for each class C, class C: Count<C> creates a new, unique instantiation of Count, for each C.
- This gives each C its own counter, vs. sharing one for over all subclasses.
- This technique - inheriting from a template specialized by yourself
    - looks weird, but happens enough to have its own name: the **Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)**
