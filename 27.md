# Problem 27: Resolving Method Overrides at Compile-Time
Recall: Template Method Pattern:

```c++
class Turtle {
    public:
    void draw() {
        drawHead();
        drawShell();
        drawFeet();
    }
    private:
    void drawHead();
    virtual void drawShell() = 0;
    void drawFeet();
};

class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
    void drawShell() override;
};
```

Consider:
```c++
template <typename T> class Turtle {
    public:
    void draw() {
        drawHead();
        static_cast<T*>(this)->drawShell();
        drawFeet();
    }
    private:
    void drawHead();
    void drawFeet();
}

class RedTurtle: public Turtle<RedTurtle> {
    friend class Turtle;
    void drawShell();
}
```
- No virtual methods, no vtable lookup

```c++
class GreenTurtle: public Turtle<GreenTurtle> {
    ...
};
```
Drawback: 
- no relationship between RedTurtle + GreenTurtle, cant store a mix of them in a container.
- Can give Turtle class a parent.

```c++
template <typename T> class Turtle: public Enemy {
    ...
}
```

Then can store RedTurtle and GreenTurtles.
- But can't access draw method.
- Could give Enemy a virtual method.

```c++
class Enemy {
    public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;
};
```
- but then there will be a vtable lookup.
- on the other hand, if Turtle::draw calls several would be virtual helpers, could trade away several vtable lookups for one.
