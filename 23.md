# Problem 23: Shared Ownership
Is C++ hard? No (if you're a client programmer)

But explicit memory management
- use vector if you need an array
- use unique_ptr if you need a heap obj.
- use stack-allocated objects as much as possible

If you follow these, you should never have to say delete or delete[].

But unique_ptr doesn't respect is-a

```c++
unique_ptr<Base> p (new Derived); // OK
p->virtfn(); // runs derived version, OK

unique_ptr<Derived> q = ...
unique_ptr<Base> = std::move(q); // Type error.
// No conversion between unique_ptr<Derived> and unique_ptr<Base>
// Note: std::unique_ptr can do this, but our version cannot.
```

Easy to fix:
```c++
template <typename T> class unique_ptr {
	T *p;
	...
	public:
	...
	template <typename U> unique_ptr(unique_ptr<U> &&q): p{q.p} {q.p = nullptr;}
	template <typename U> unique_ptr &operator=(unique_ptr<U> &&q) {
		std::swap(p, q.p);
		return *this;
	}
}
```
- Works for any unique_ptr whose ptr is assignment_compatible with this->p
e.g. subtypes of T, but not supertypes of T.

But I want two smart ptrs pointing at the same object. 
- Why? the pointer that owns the object should be a unique_ptr
- all others could be raw pointers

When would you want true shared ownership?

Recall (Racket):
```racket
(define l1 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 empty))))
(define l2 (cons 4 (rest (l1))))
+-+-+   +-+-+   +-+-+
|1|*|-->|2|*|-->|3|\|
+-+-+   +-+-+   +-+-+
         ^
+-+-+    |
|4|*|----+
+-+-+
```
- Shared data structures ar ea nightmare in C - how can we ensure each node is freed exactly once?
- Easy in garbage collected languages.

What can C++ do?
```c++
template <typename T> class shared_ptr {
	T *p;
	int *refcount;
	public:
};
// refcount counts how many shared_ptrs point at *p
// updated each time a shared_ptr is initalized/assigned/destroyed
// refcount is shared among all shared_ptrs that point to *p
// p is only deleted if its refcount reaches 0.
// implementation details - exercise
```

Now deallocation is easy - as easy as garbage collection

Just watch: cycles
```c++
+-+-+   +-+-+
|1|*|-->|2|*|
+-+-+   +-+-+ 
 ^         |
 +---------+
```
- If you have cyclic data - you may have to physically break the cycle. (or use weak_ptrs)

Also watch: 
```c++
Book *p = new ...
shared_ptr<Book> p1 {p};
shared_ptr<Book> p2 {p};
```
- shared_ptrs are not mind-readers
- p1 and p2 will not share a ref count. - BAD
- if you want 2 shared_ptrs at an object, create one shared_ptr and copy it.

But - you can't dynamic_cast these pointers:
```c++
template <typename T, typename U> 
shared_ptr<T> dynamic_pointer_cast(const shared_ptr<U> &spu) {
	return shared_ptr<T>(dynamic_cast<T*>(spu.get()));
}
similarly- const_pointer_cast, static_pointer_cast
```
