Problem 14: Memory management is hard!
=======================================
Imagine a conversation:

*Complainer: Memory Management is hard!*

No it isn't:
- Vectors 
	- do everything arrays can
	- grow as needed in O(1) amortized time or better
	- clean up automatically once out of scope

Just use vectors, and you'll never have to manage arrays again.
C++ has enough abstraction facilities to make programming easier than C.

*But what about single objects?*

```c++
void f() {
	posn *p = new Posn{1,2};
	...
	delete p; // must deallocate the Posn!
}
```
- Do you really need to use the heap though?
- Could you use the stack instead?
```c++
void f() {
	Posn p {1,2};
	...
} // No cleanup necessary
```

Sometimes you do need the heap:
```c++
void f() {
	Posn *p = new Posn{1,2};
	if (some_condition) throw BadNews{};
	delete p;

	// p is leaked if f throws. Unacceptable.
}
```

Raising and handling an exception should not corrupt the program.
- We desire __exception safety__.

Leaks are a corruption of your program's memory, they will eventually degrade performance and crash the program.

If a program cannot recover from an exception without corrupting its memory then what is the point of recovering?

There are 3 levels of __exception safety__:
1. __Basic guarantee__ - once an exception has been handled, the program is in some valid state - No leaked memory, no corrupted data structures, all invariants maintained.
2. __Strong guarantee__ - if an exception propogates out of a function f, then the state of the program will be as if f had not been called - f either succeeds completely or not at all.
3. __Nothrow guarantee__ - a function f offers the nothrow guarantee if f never emits an exception, but must always accomplish its purpose

We will revisit this. For now, back to f...

```c++
void f() {
	Posn *p = new Posn{1,2};
	if (some_condition) {
		delete p;
		throw BadNews{};
	}
	delete p;
	// two deletes: duplicated effort! memory management is even harder!
}
```

Want to guarantee that `delete p;` happens no matter what.

What guarantees does C++ offer? Only one: Destructors for stack allocated objects will be called when the objects go out of scope.

So create a class with a destructor that deletes the pointer.

```c++
template <typename T> class unique_ptr {
	T *p;
public:
	unique_ptr(T *p): p{p} {}
	~unique_ptr() { delete p; }
	T *get() const { return p; }
	T release() { 
		T *q = p;
		p = nullptr;
		return q;
	}
}

void f() {
	unique_ptr<Posn> p {new Posn{1,2}};
	if (some_condition) throw BadNews{};
}
```
Now we have less memory management effor than we started with.

Using unique pointer: can use get to fetch the raw pointer.
Better: make unique_ptr act like a pointer.
```c++
template <typename T> class unique_ptr {
	T *p;
public:
	unique_ptr(T *p): p{p} {}
	~unique_ptr() { delete p; }
	T *get() const { return p; }
	T release() { 
		T *q = p;
		p = nullptr;
		return q;
	}

	// new:
	T &operator*() const { return *p; }
	T *operator->() const { return p; }
	explicit operator bool() const { return p; }
	// prohibits bool b = p;
	void reset(T *p1) {
		delete p;
		p = p1;
	}
	void swap(unique_ptr<T> &x) { std::swap(p, x.p); }
};

void f() {
	unique_ptr<Posn> p {new Posn{1,2}};
	cout << p->x << " " << p->y << endl;
}
```

But consider:
```c++
unique_ptr<Posn> p {new Posn{1,2}};
unique_ptr<Posn> q = p;		// 2 pointers to the same object
// when destructors are called, it will be deleted twice
```
Solution: copying unique_ptrs is not allowed. Moving is ok though!
```c++
template <typename T> class unique_ptr {
	...
public:
	unique_ptr(const unique_ptr &other) = delete;
	unique_ptr &operator=(const unique_ptr &other) = delete;
	unique_ptr(const unique_ptr &&other): p{other.p} {other.p = nullptr;}
	unique_ptr &operator=(const unique_ptr &&other) {
		swap(other);
		return *this;
	}
};
```

Small exception safety issue: Consider:
```c++
class C {...};
void f(unique_ptr<c> x, int y) {...}
int g() {...}
f(unique_ptr<c> {new c;}, g());
```
C++ does not enforce order of argument evaluation:
It could be:
1. new C
2. g()
3. `unique_ptr<c> {1}`

Then what if g throws? 1 is leaked.
- Can fix this by making 1 and 3 inseparable: use a helper function

```c++
template<typename T, typename... Args> unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Args&&... args) {
	return unique_ptr<T> {new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...)};
}

f(make_unique<C>(), g());
// no leak if g throws.
```

unique_ptr is an example of the C++ idiom: **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)**
- any resource that must be propery released (memory, file handle, etc) should be wrapped in a stack-allocated object whose destructor frees it.
- Examples: unique_ptr, ifstream/ofstream
- Acquire the resource when the object is initialized.
- Release it when the object's destructor runs.
