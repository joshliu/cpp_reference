Problem 1: Program Input/Output
==================================================

Read Section 2.2, 4.3

Running a program from the command line
- ./program-name or path/to/program-name

Providing input: 2 ways
1> ./program-name arg1 arg2 ... argn
	- args are written into the program's memory
```wow
+---------------+
|     Code      |
+---------------+
|      n+1      |
+---------------+
|       * ------|----> ./program-name
+---------------+
|       * ------|----> arg2
+---------------+
|               |
+---------------+
|       * ------|----> argn
+---------------+
```
2> ./program-name, then type something
	- input comes through standard input stream (stdin)
	stdin -> program -> (stderr, stdout)
	- stderr never buffered, stdout maybe buffered

Redirection:
./myprogram < infile > outfile 2> errfile


Consider (C):
FILE: ../lec-code/cat

Observe: cmd line args/input from stdin are 2 different programming techniques.

To compile:
gcc -std=c00 -Wall myprogram.c -o myprogram

-Wall (show all warnings)

^D - end-of-file
^C - kill the program

This program - simplification of linux 'cat' command.
cat file1 file2 - opens them and prints one after another.

cat - echoes stdin
cat < file 	- file was used as source for stdin
		- the shell opens the file, displays

Now Can we write cat in C++?
- already valid C++.

The "C++ way"
- Command line args - same as in C.
- stdin/stdout: #include <iostream>
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	int x,y;
	std::cin >> x >> y;
	std::cout << x + y << std::endl;
}
```
- std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr - streams with types std::istream and std::ostream

- \>> is the input operator, cin >> x, populates x as a side effect, returns cin
- << is the output operator cout << x + y, prints x+y as a side effect, returns cout

File access: 
```c++
std::ifstream f{"name-of-file"};
char c;
while (f >> c) {
	std::cout << c;
}
```

f >> c returns f, which implicitly converts to a bool. true = read success, false = read failed

stream input skips whitespace, just like scanf.
to include whitespace:
```c++
std::ifstream f{"...."};
f >> std::noskipws;
char c;
```

Note: important!
- no explicit calls to fopen/fclose
- initializing f {"name of file"} opens the file.
- file is closed when scope of variable ends

Try 'cat' in C++:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

void echo(istream &f) {
	char c;
	f >> noskipws;
	while (f >> c) cout << c;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc == 1) echo(cin);
	else {
		for (int i = 1; i < argc; ++i) {
			ifstream f {argv[i]};
			echo(f);
		}
	}
}
```

cin has type istream - echo takes an istream
f has type ifstream - is echo(f) a type mismatch? no, this is fine. ifstream is a subtype of istream, so any ifstream can be treated as ifstream.

The error is: you can't write a function that takes an istream the way that echo does.
Compare:
```C
int x;
scanf("%d", &x);
```
vs
```c++
cin >> x;
```

C and C++ are pass by value languages, so scanf needs the address of x in order to change x, via pointers.
So why is it not cin >> &x?
C++ has another pointer-like type: Reference.

References:
```c++
int y = 10;
int &z = y; 	// z is called an lvalue reference to y.
		// similar to int * const z = y; but with auto dereferencing.

z = 12;		// y is now 12

int *p = &z;	// gives the addr of y.
```

In all cases, z acts as if it were y. z is an alias for y.

lvalue references must be initialized to something that has an address.

Problem 1 Continued 9/12/17 (Lecture 2)
=======================================

Why won't cat in C++ work?

## References
```c++
int y = 10;
int &z = y;
z = 12;
&z;
```


Cannot create a pointer to a reference, but a reference to a pointer is ok. e.g. int&\*x;

Cannot create a reference to a reference; e.g. int &&r = z;

Cannot create an array of references.

Can use references as function parameters.
```c++
void inc(int n) {
        ++n;
}
int x = 5;
inc(x);
cout << x; 		// returns 5
```

```c++
void inc(int &n) {	// const pointer to arg x
	++n;		// no pointer dereference
}
int x = 5;
inc(x);
cout << x; 		// returns 6
```

cin >> x works because x is passed by ref.

istream&operator >> (istream &in, int &n);

Now consider struct ReallyBig{ ... };
int f(ReallyBig rb) { ... }	// no more struct Really Big rb. Pass by value, so it copies the struct (slow)

int g(ReallyBig &rb) {...}	// reference, not copy (fast)

int h(const ReallyBig &rb) {...} // fast, no copy, h can't change rb.

Prefer pass-by-const-ref over pass-by-value for anything larger than a pointer, unless the function needs to make a copy anyway - just use pass by value.

Consider:
```c++
int f(int &n) {...}
int g(const int &n) {...}

f(5) // fails because can't initialize an lvalue ref to a literal value
g(5) // allowed, since n can never be changed. 5 stored in smoe temp location, so n has something to point to.
```

## Back to cat.

void echo(istream f) {...}
f passed by value, so istream is copied. but istream can't be copied lmao.

Works if you pass the stream by ref.

To compile:
```
g++ -std=c++14 -Wall
```

Separate Compilation
- put echo function in its own module.

Correct:
```
g++14 -c echo.cc
g++14 -c main.cc

g++14 echo.o main.o -o mycat
```
-c flag means only compile, dont link.

Advantage: only have to recompile the parts you change and relink.
Change echo.h - must recompile echo.cc and main.cc and relink.

What if you don't remember what we changed, or what depends on what?

Linux Tool: make
Create a Makefile.
Contents:
```
mycat: main.o echo.o
	g++ main.o echo.o -o mycat

main.o: main.cc echo.h
	g++ std=c++14 -Wall -g -c main.cc

echo.o: echo.cc echo.h
	g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -g -c echo.cc

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm main.o echo.o main
```

targets: mycat, main.o
dependencies: everything right of colon
recipes: tabbed information

How make works: list a dir in long form

-rw-r----- 	1	j629liu	j629liu	25	Sep 9 15:27	echo.cc
permissions	links	owner	group	size	last modified	name

Starting at the leaves of the dependency graph:
- if the dependency is newer than the target, rebuild the target, and so on, up until the root target.

Shortcuts - use variables:
```
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = 0std=c++14 -Wall
EXEC = myprogram
OBJECTS = main.o echo.o
${EXEC}: ${OBJECTS}
	${CXX} ${OBJECTS} -o ${EXEC}

main.o: main.cc echo.h
echo.o: echo.cc echo.h

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm ${OBJECTS} ${EXEC}
```

Omit recipes- make will guess the right one.

Writing dependencies is still hard, but the compiler can help.
g++14 -c -MMD echo.cc // generates echo.o, echo.d

```
cat echo.d:
	echo.o echo.cc echo.h

CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++14 -Wall -MMD
EXEC = mycat
OBJECTS = main.o echo.o
DEPENDS = ${OBJECTS:.o=.d}
${EXEC}: ${OBJECTS}
	${CXX} ${OBJECTS} -o ${EXEC}

-include ${DEPENDS}

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm ${EXEC} ${OBJECTS} ${DEPENDS}
```

Moral of the story: always use makefiles, and create the makefiles before coding.
