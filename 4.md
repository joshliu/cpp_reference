Problem 4: Copies
=================

```c++
vector v;
v.push_back(100);

vector w = v;	// Allowed - constructs w as a copy of v.
w.itemAt(0);	// 100
v.itemAt(0) = 200;
w.itemAt(0);	// 200;
```

What we have here is a <u>Shallow Copy</u>.
- v and w are sharing data.
- vector w = v - constructs w as a copy of v.
	- invokes the <u>copy constructor</u>.

```c++
struct Vector {
	vector (const Vector &other) { ... } // copy constructor
};
```

If you want a deep copy - write your own copy constructor.
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	...
	Node(const Node &other): data{other.data}, 
		next{ other.next? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr } { }
}
```

Now consider this:
```c++
vector v;
vector w;
w = v;	// this is a copy but not a construction

// this uses copy assignment operator
// compiler-supplied: copies each field (shallow)
// w's old fields are leaked
```

Deep copy assignment:
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	...
	Node &operator=(const Node &other) {
		data = other.data;
		delete next;

		next = other.next ? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr;
		return *this;

	}
}
```
But this is wrong - dangerous. 

Consider: 
```c++
Node n { ... };
n=n; // goodbye world;
```
This destroys n's data and then copies it.

Must always make sure that operator = works in the case of self-assignment.
```c++
Node &Node::operator=(const Node &other) {
	if (this == &other) return *this
	// else is the same as before
}
```

### Alternative: copy and swap idiom

```c++
#include <utility>
Struct Node {

	void swap(Node &other) {
		using std::swap;
		swap(data, other.data);
		swap(next, other.next);
	}

	Node &operator=(const Node &other) {
		Node tmp = other; // uses copy constructor
		swap(tmp);
		return *this;
	}
};

```
