# Problem 25: I want an even faster vector.

In the good old days of C, you could copy an array (even an array of structs) very quickly, by calling memcpy (similar to strcpy, but for arbitrary memory, not just string)

memcpy was probably written in assembly, and was as fast as the machine could possibly be.

Nowadays in C++, copies invoke copy constructures, which are costly function calls.

But there is good news.
In C++, a type is considered POD (plain old data) if it:
- has a trivial default constructor (equiv. to =default)
- is trivially copyable - copy/move operations, destructor have default implementations
- is standard layout - no virtual methods or bases, all members have same visibility, no reference members, no fields in both base class and subclass, or in multiple base classes.

For POD types, semantics is compatible with C, and memcpy is safe to use.

How can we use it - only safe if T is a POD type.

One option: use std::is_pod<T>::value at runtime.
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
    size_t size, cap;
    T *theVector;
    public:
    ...
    vector(const vector &other): ... {
        if (std::is_pod<T>::value) {
            memcpy(theVector, other.theVector, n*sizeof(T));
        }
        else {
            // as before
        }
    }
};
```
- Works, but condition is evaluated at run-time, but result is known at compile time. (compiler may or may not optimize)

Second option: no runtime cost
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
    ...
    public:
    ...
    template <typename X=T> 
    vector(enable_if<std::is_pod<X>::value, const T&>::type other): ... {
        memcpy(theVector, other.theVector, n*sizeof(T));
    }

    template <typename X=T>
    vector(enable_if<!std::is_pod<X>::value, const T&>::type other): ... {
        // original implementation
    }
};
```
How does this work?
```c++
template <bool b, typename T> struct enable_if;
template <typename T> struct enable_if<true, T> {
    using type = T;
};
```
With metaprogramming, what you don't say is as important as what you do say.

If b is true, enable_if defines a struct whose 'type' member typedef is T.

So if `std::is_pod<T>::value` is true, then `enable_if<is_pod<T>::value, const vector<T>&>::type` is `const vector<T>&`

If b is false, the struct is declared but not defined, so `enable_if<b, T>` will not compile. One of the two versions of the copy constructor won't compile (false condition).

Then how is this a valid program?

**C++ rule: SFINAE - Substitution Failure Is Not An Error**
- In other words, if t is a type, `template <typename T> _ f (_) {_}` is a template function, and substituting `T = t` results in an invalid function, the compiler does not signal an error, it just removes that instantiation from consideration during overload resolution.
- On the other hand, if no version of the function is in scope and substitutes validly, that is an error.

Question: Why is this wrong?
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
    ...
    public:
    vector(typename enable_if<std::is_pod<T>::value, const vector<T>&>::type other): ... {...}
};
```
I.e. why do we need the extra template outfront?

Because SFINAE applies to template functions, and these methods are ordinary functions, not templates
- They depend on T, but T's value was determined when you decided what to put in the vector.
- If substituting T=T fails, it will invalidate the entire vector class, not just the method.

So make the mthod a separate template, with a new arg X, which can be defaulted to T, and do `is_pod<x>`, `not is_pod<x>`.

...this compiles, but when we run it, it crashes.

Why? Hint: if you put debug statements into both of these constructors, they don't print.
- Answer: we're getting the compiler supplied copy constructor, which is doing shallow copies.

These templates are not enough to suppress the auto-generated copy constructor
- and a non-templated match is always preferred to a templated one.

What do we do about it? Could try:
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
    ...
    public:
    vector(const vector &other)=delete; // i.e. disable the copy constructor
};
```
- However the compiler won't let you do this, can't disable the copy constructor and then create one.

Solution that works: overloading.
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
    struct dummy{};
    ...
    public:
    vector(const vector &other): vector{other, dummy{}} {}
    // this is constructor delegation.
    template <typename X=T>
    vector(typename enable_if<std::is_pod<T>::value, const vector <T>&>::type other, dummy) {
        ...
    }
    template <typename X=T>
    vector(typename enable_if<!std::is_pod<T>::value, const vector <T>&>::type other, dummy) {
        ...
    }
}
```
- overload the constructor with an unused dummy arg.
- have the copy constructor delegate to the overloaded constructor
- copy constructor is inline, so no function call overhead
- **this works.**

As of 2014, can write some "helper" definitions to make `is_pod` and `enable_if` easier to use.
```c++
template <typename T> constexpr bool is_pod_v = std::ispod<T>::value;
template <bool v, typename T> using enable_if_t = typename enable_if<T>::type;

template <typename T> class vector {
    ...
    public:
    ...
    template <typename X=T> vector(enable_if_t<is_pod_v<x>, const vector<T>&> other, dummy) {...}
     template <typename X=T> vector(enable_if_t<!is_pod_v<x>, const vector<T>&> other, dummy) {...}
};
```

## Move/forward implementation:
- We not have enough machinery to implement `std::move` and `std::forward`.

`std::move` - first attempt
```c++
template <typename T> T&& move(T &&x) {
    return static_cast<T&&> (x);
}
```
- Doesn't quite work. T&& is a universal ref, not an rvalue ref.
- If x was an lvalue ref, T&& is an lvalue ref.
- Need to make sure T is not an lvalue ref.
    - If T is an lvalue ref, get rid of the ref.

std::move - correct:
```c++
template <typename T> inline typename std::remove_reference<T>::type&& move(T&& x) {
    return static_cast<typename std::remove_reference<T>::type &&>(x);
}
```
- `std::remove_reference<T>` turns t&, t&& into t.
- Exercise - Write remove_reference

Question: Can we save typing and use auto?
```c++
template <typename T> auto move(T &&x) {...}
```

Answer: NO!
```c++
int z;
int &y = z;
auto x = y; // x is int.
```

By ref auto&& is a universal reference.

Need a type definition rule that doesn't discard refs

decltype(...) - returns the type that ... was declared to have.
decltype(var) - returns the declared type of the var
decltype(expr) - returns lvalue or rvalue ref, depending on whether the expr is an lvalue or rvalue.

```c++
int z;
int &y = z;
decltype(y) x = z; // x is int&
x = 4; // affects z

auto a = z;
a = 4; // does not affect z.

decltype (z) s= z; // s is an int
s = 5; // does not affect z.

decltype((z)) r = z; // r is int&
r = 5; // does affect z.
```

Thus:
```c++
decltype(auto) - perform type deduction, like auto, but use decltype rules.
```

Correct move:
```c++
template <typename T> decltype(auto) move(T &&x) {
    return static_cast<std::remove_reference_t<T> &&>(x);
}
```

`std::forward`:
```c++
template <typename T> inline T&& forward(T &&x) {
    return static_cast<T&&>(x);
}
```
- Reasoning: If x is an lvalue, T&& is an lvalue ref. If x is an rvalue, T&& is an rvalue ref.
- Doesn't work. forward is called on exprs that are lvalues, that may "point" at rvalues.

e.g.
```c++
template <typename T> void f(T&& y) {
    ...forward(y)...
}
```
- forward(y) will always yield an lvalue ref.

In order to work, forward must know what type (including l/rvalue) was deduced for y, i.e. needs to know T.

So in principle, `forward<T>(y)` would work.

But: 2 problems
- Supplying T means T&& is no longer universal.
- Want to prevent user from omitting `<T>`

Instead: separate lvalue/rvalue cases.
```c++
template <typename T> inline constexpr T&& forward(std::remove_reference_t<T> &x) noexcept {
    return static_cast<T&&>(x);
}
template <typename T> inline constexpr T&& forward(std::remove_reference_t<T> &&x) noexcept {
    return static_cast<T&&>(x);
}
```
