# Problem 32: A fixed-size object allocator
A custom allocator can be fast.

Fixed size allocator: all allocated chunks are the same size (i.e customized for one class), so no need to keep track of sizes.

(aside - many traditional allocators store the size of the block before the pointer, so that the allocator knows how much space is attatched to that pointer.)

Fixed-size - saves space (no hidden size field)
- saves time - no hunting for a block of the right size.

Approach:
Create a pool of memory - an array large enough to hold n T objects.
