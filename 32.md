# Problem 32: A fixed-size object allocator
A custom allocator can be fast.

Fixed size allocator: all allocated chunks are the same size (i.e customized for one class), so no need to keep track of sizes.

(aside - many traditional allocators store the size of the block before the pointer, so that the allocator knows how much space is attatched to that pointer.)

Fixed-size - saves space (no hidden size field)
- saves time - no hunting for a block of the right size.

Approach:
Create a pool of memory - an array large enough to hold n T objects.

Initially:
```
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
|1 |2 |3 |4 |5 | ... |-1|
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
 0  1  2  3  4        n-1
```

When the client has a slot: T obj:
When we have it:
- node in a linked list.
- each slot stores the index of the next slot in the list.

Allocation: from the front.
```
First free: 1
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
|//|2 |3 |4 |5 | ... |-1|
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
 0  1  2  3  4        n-1

First free: 2
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
|//|//|3 |4 |5 | ... |-1|
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
 0  1  2  3  4        n-1
```

Deallocation:
```
Free item 0:
First free: 0
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
|2 |//|3 |4 |5 | ... |-1|
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
 0  1  2  3  4        n-1

Free item 1:
First free: 1
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
|2 |0 |3 |4 |5 | ... |-1|
+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+
 0  1  2  3  4        n-1
```

Implementation:
```c++
template <typename T, int n> class fsAlloc {
    union Slot { // slot large enough for a T, but still usable as an int.
        int next;
        T data;
        Slot(): next{0} {}
    };
    Slot theSlots[n];
    int first = 0;
    public:
    fsAlloc() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) theSlots[i] = i+1;
        theSlots[n-1] = -1;
    }
    T *allocate() noexcept {
        if (first == -1) return nullptr;
        T *result = &(theSlots[first].data);
        first = theSlots[first].next;
        return result;
    }
    void deallocate(void *item) noexcept {
        int index = (static_cast<char*>(item)-reinterpret_cast<char*>(theSlots))/sizeof(Slot);
        // char* has size 1
        theSlots[index].next = first;
        first = index;
    }
};
```

Use in a class:
```c++
class Student final {
    int assns, mt, final;
    static fsAlloc<Student, SIZE> pool; // size is how many you can allocate.
    public:
    ...
    static void* operator new(size_t size) {
        if (size != sizeof(Student)) throw std::bad_alloc;
        // already kinda avoided because Student is final class:
        // can't have subclasses which are likely larger
        while (true) {
            void *p = pool.allocate();
            if (p) return p;
            std::new_handler h = std::set_new_handler(0);
            std::set_new_handler(h);
            if (h) h();
            else throw std::bad_alloc{};
        }
    }
    static void operator delete(void *p) noexcept {
        if (p == nullptr) return;
        pool.deallocate(p);
    }
};

fsAlloc<Student,SIZE> Student::pool;
```

main.cc:
```
int main() {
    Student *s1 = new Student;
    Student *s2 = new Student; // these are using custom allocator
    delete s1;
    delete s2; // these are using custom deallocator
}
```

Q: Where do s1, s2 reside?

A: static memory (Not the heap)
- could arrange for stack/heap memory

More notes: we used a union to simultaneously hold both int and T.
- could have used a struct `[next][T]`
- disadvantage: if you access a dangling T pointer, you can corrupt the linked list.

eg. 
```c++
Student *s = new Student;
delete s;
s->setAssns(...); // destroys the pool
```
Lesson: following a dangling pointer can be very dangerous.

With a struct, next is before the T obj, so you have to work hard to corrupt it.

```c++
reinterpret_cast<int *>(s)[-1] = ...;
```

On the other hand - with a struct - problems if T doesn't have a default constructor.

eg.
```c++
struct Slot {
    int next;
    T data;
};
slot theSlots[n]; // doesn't work if T has no default constructor.
// can't do operator new/placement new
```

```c++
union SlotChar {
    char dummy;
    Slot S;
    SlotChar():dummy{0} {}
};
```
Also, why store indices instead of pointers?
- smaller than pointers on this machine, so waste no memory as long as T >= size of an int.
- would waste if T smaller than an int
- could use a smaller index type (as long as you don't want more items than the type can hold)
- could make the index type a param of the template.
Student final - fixed size allocator - subclasses might be larger
    - options have no subclasses.
    - check size, throw if it isn't the right size.
    - or, give derived class its own allocator.
