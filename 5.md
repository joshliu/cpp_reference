Problem 5: Moves
================

Consider:
```c++
Node plusOne(Node n) {
	for (Node *p = &n; p; p = p->next) {
		++p->data;
	}
	return n;
}

Node n {1, new Node{2, nullptr}};

Node m = plusOne(n); // call to copy constructor
// but what is "other" here? reference to what?

Node m;
m = plusOne(n); // call to copy assignment
```
- Other is a reference to a Temporary Object: Created to hold the result of plusOne(n)
- Copy constructor deep copies the data from this temporary.

But: the temporary is just going to be thrown out anyways, as soon as the statement Node m = plusOne(n) is done.
- wasteful to deep copy the temp, why not just steal the data instead?
- Need to be able to tell whether other is a reference to a temporary object, or a standalone object.

## Rvalue References
Node && is a reference to a temporary object (rvalue) of type Node.

Version of the constructor that takes a Node &&.
```c++
struct Node {
	...
	// below is called a move constructor - steals other's data
	Node (Node &&other): data{other.data}, next{other.next} {
		other.next = nullptr;
	}

	// move assignment operator - need to: steal other's data, delete my old data
	Node &operator=(Node &&other) {
		using std::swap;			// lets just swap with other
		swap(data, other.data);
		swap(next, other.next);
		return *this;

	}

};
```

Can combine copy/move assignment:
```
struct Node {
	...
	// below is a unified assignment operator
	// pass by value - invokes copy constructor if other is an lvalue,
	// invokes move constructor if other is an rvalue
	Node *operator=(Node other) {
		swap(other);
		return *this;
	}
};
```
Note: copy/swap can be more expensive than necessary, so hand coded operators may do less copying.

But now consider:
```c++
struct Student {
	std::string name;
	Student(const string &name):name {name} {}
	// what if name poitns to an rvalue?
};
```

```c++
struct Student {
	std::string name;
	Student(std::string name): name{name} {}
	// copies if name is an lvalue, moves if name is an rvalue
}
```

```c++
struct Student {
	std::string name;
	// name is an lvalue in this case
	Student(std::string name): name{std::move(name)} {}
	// std::move() forces name to be treated as an rvalue
	// now uses string's move constructor.
};
```

Move constructor:
```c++
Struct Student {
	...
	// other points at an rvalue, but is an lvalue.
	Student(Student &&other): name{std::move(other.name)} {}

	Student &operator=(Student other) {
		name = std::move(other.name);
	}
};
```

If you don't define move operations, copy ones will be used.
If you do define move operations, they replace copy operations whenever the argument is an rvalue (temporary).

# Lecture 8, 9/26/17
Recall: copies, moves, std::move

```c++
vector makeAVector() {
	return vector{};		// basic constructor
};

vector v = makeAVector();	// move constructor? copy constructor?
```

This is known as <u>Copy/Move Elision</u>

Try this in g++ - just the basic constructor called, no copy/move.

In some circumstances, the compiler is allowed to skip calling copy/move constructors (but doesn't have to)

makeAVector writes result directly into the space occupied by v, rather than copy/move it later.

```c++
vector v = vector{}; // Formally a basic construction and a copy/move construction.

// Here though, the compiler is required to elide the copy/move, so basic constructor only.

vector v = vector{vector{vector{}}};

// this is still one basic constructor only.

void doSomething(vector v) { ... } // pass by value (copy/move constructor)

doSomething(makeAVector());
// result of makeAVector written directly into the param, so no copy/move.
// this is allowed, even if dropping constructor calls would change the behavior of the program
```

If you need all constructors to run:
```
g++14 -fno_elide_constructors
```
- can slow down program considerably

### In summary: Rule of 5 (Big 5)
- If you need to customize any one of 
	1. Copy constructor
	2. Copy assignment
	3. Destructor
	4. Move constructor
	5. Move assignment
	then you usually need to customize all 5.
