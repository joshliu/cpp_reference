Problem 16 - Insert/remove in the middle
========================================

A method like `vector<T>::insert(size_t i, const T &x)` is easy to write.

But the same for `list<T>` requires an up-front traversal.

Using iterators can be good for both.
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	iterator insert(iterator posn, const T&x) {
		increaseCap();
		ptrdiff_t offset = posn - begin();
		iterator newPosn = begin() + offset;
		new (static_cast<void*>(end())) T (std::move(*(end() - 1)));
		++vb.n;
		for (iterator it = end-1; it != posn; --it) {
			*it = std::move(*(it - 1));
		}
		*newPosn = x;
		return newPosn;
	}
};
```
Exception safe? Assuming T's copy/move operations are exception safe (at least basic guarantee), insert offers the basic guarantee.
- May get a partially shuffled vector, but it will be a valid vector.

Note: if you have other iterators pointing at the vector:
```
+---+---+---+---+-------+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | ..... |
+---+---+---+---+-------+
  ^	  ^   ^   ^ 
  i1  i2  h   i4
```
and you insert at "h":

```
+---+---+---+---+---+-----+
| 1 | 2 | 5 | 3 | 4 | ... |
+---+---+---+---+---+-----+
  ^	      ^   ^ 
  i1     h,i2 i4
```
- i2 will now point at a different item.

Convention: after a call to insert or erase all iterators pointing after the point of insertion/erasure are considered invalid and should not be used.

Also, if a reallocation happens, all iterators pointing into the vector become invalid.

Exercises:
- erase- remove the item pointed to by an iterator, return an iterator to the point of erasure.
- emplace- like insert, but takes constructor args.

BUT:
- that means that there is a problem with push_back.
- If increaseCap succsessfully reallocates and placement new (constructor) trhwos, the vector is the same, but iterators were invalidated

Exercise: fix this.
