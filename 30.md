# Problem 30 - Total Control

Can control:
- param passing
- initialization
- method call resolution
- etc.

### Control over memory allocation
Memory allocators are tricky to write - 2 Questions: Why and how?

#### Why write an allocator?
- built-in one is too slow
    - general purpose, not optimized for specific use.
    - eg. if you know you will always allocate objects of the same size, a custom allocator may perform better.
- you want to optimize locality.
    - maybe you want a separate heap, jsut for objects of some class C - keeps the objects close to each other, may improve performance
- you want to use "special memory"
    - put objects in shared memory
- you want to profile the program.
    - collect stats

### How do you customize allocation?
- overload operator new
    - if you define a global non-member operator new, all allocations in your program will use your allocator.
    - Also, if you write operator new, you need to write operator delete. otherwise undefined behavior.

```c++
void *operator new(size_t size) {
    cout << "Request for " << size << " bytes \n";
    return malloc(size);
}

void operator delete(void *p) {
    cout << "Freeing " << p << endl;
    free(p);
}

int main() {
    int *x = new int;
    delete x;
}
```
- Works, but is not correct. Doesn't adhere to convention. If operator new fails, it is supposed to throw bad_alloc.
- Actually, if operator new fails, it is supposed to call the new_handler function.
    - the new_handler can: 
        - free up space(somehow)
        - install a different new_handler / uninstall the current
        - throw bad_alloc
        - abort or exit
    - new_handler should be called in an infinite loop
    - if new_handler is nullptr, operator new throws
- Also - new must return a valid pointer if size == 0, and delete of a null ptr must be safe.

Corrected implementation:
```c++
#include <new>
void *operator new(size_t size) {
    cout << "Request for " << size << " bytes \n";
    if (size == 0) size = 1;
    while (true) {
        void *p = malloc(size);
        if (p) return p;
        std::new_handler h = std::set_new_handler(0);
        std::set_new_handler(h);
        if (h) h();
        else throw std::bad_alloc{};
    }
}

void operator delete(void *p) {
    if (p == nullptr) return;
    cout << "Freeing " << p << endl;
    free(p);
}
```

Replacing global operator new/delete affects your entire program.

More likely - replace on a class-by-class basis
- especially if you are writing allocators specifically tuned to the sizes of your objects.

To do this - make operator new/delete members
- must be *static* members.

```c++
class C {
    public: ...
    static void *operator new(size_t size) {
        cout << "Running C's allocator" << endl;
        return ::operator new(size);
    }
    static void operator delete(void *p) noexcept {
        cout << "Freeing " << p << endl;
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};
```

Generalize - log to an abritrary stream
```c++
class C {
    public:
    static void *operator new(size_t size, std::ostream &out) {
        out << ... << endl;
        return ::operator new(size);
    }
};

C *x = new(cout) c; // log to cout
ofstream f {...};
C *y = new(f) c;
```

Must also write the corresponding "placement" delete.
```c++
class C {
    public:
    ...
    static void operator delete(void *p, std::ostream &out) noexcept {
        out << "Placement delete: " << p << endl;
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};
```
Won't compile! You also need to write ordinary delete.

```c++
class C {
    public:
    ...
    static void operator delete(void *p) noexcept {
        out << "Ordinary delete (cout): " << p << endl;
        ::operator delete(p);
    }
};

// This will compile, however:

C *p = new (cout) c;    // Running C's allocator
delete p;               // Ordinary delete (cout)
```
- If the client calls delete p, there needs to be a non-specialized operator delete, else compile error.
- How can you call specialized delete? You can't. Then why do we need it?
    - If the constructor that called specialized operator new throws, it will call the specialized operator delete that matches operator new.
    - If there isn't one, no delete gets called, so leak.

e.g.
```c++
class C {
    ...
    public:
    C (bool b) {if (b) throw 0; }
};

try {
    C *p = new (cout) C {true}; // throws
    delete p; // not reached
}
catch (...) {}

C*q = new (cout) C {false};
delete q;
```
