# Problem 33 - I want a (tiny bit) smaller vector class

Currently: vector/vector_base have an allocator field

Standard allocator is stateless - has no fields

What is its size? 0? No - C++ does not allow 0 size types, messes things up like pointer arithmetic.

Every type has size >= 1. 

Practically - copiler adds a dummy char to the allocator.

So having an allocator field makes the vector larger by a byte. (probably more, due to alignment)

Having an allocator field in vector_base may add another byte (or more)

To save this space, C++ provides the empty base optimization.

Under EBO - an empty base class does not have to occupy space in an object.

So, we can eliminate the space cost of an allocator by making it a base class.

At the same time, lets make vector_base a base class of vector.

```c++
struct vector_base: Alloc {
    size_t n, cap;
    T* v;
    using Alloc::allocate;
    using Allot::deallocate;
    // etc.
    vector_base(size_t n): n{0}, cap{n}, v{allocate(n)} {}
    ~vector_base() {deallocate(v);}
};

template <typename T, typename Alloc=allocator<T>>

class vector:vector_base <T,Alloc> { //private inheritance, no is-a
    using vector_base<T,Alloc>::n;
    using vector_base<T,Alloc>::cap;
    using vector_base<T,Alloc>::v;
    using Alloc::allocate;
    using Alloc::deallocate; // or say this->allocate, this->deallocate
    public:
    ...
    // now use n,cap,v instead of vb.n, vb.cap, vb.v
}
```

`uninitialized_copy`, etc - need to call construct/destroy
- simplest - let them take an allocator as param
```c++
template <typename T, typename Alloc>
void uninitialized_fill(T *start, T *finish, const T&a, Alloc a) {
    ...
    a.construct(...);
    ...
    a.destroy(...);
    ...
}
```

How can vector pass an allocator to these functions?
`uninitialized_fill(v,v+n,x,static_cast<Alloc&>(*this));`
- cast yourself to base class reference.
Remaining details - exercise.

# Conclusions
C++ is easy because it is hard.
