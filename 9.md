Problem 9: Staying in bounds
=============================
```c++
vector v;
v.push_back(4);
v.push_back(5);
v[2];	// out of bounds, may or may not crash
```

Can we make this safer?
- Adding bounds checks to operator[] may be needlessly expensive.
- Could have a second, safer fetch operator

```c++
class vector {
	...
public:
	int &at(size_t i) {
		if (i < n) return theVector[i];
		// how do we show that v.at(2) is wrong
		// return any int - looks like non-error
		// Returning a non-int - not type correct
		// Crash the program - can we do better?
	}
};
```

### Solution: Raise an exception
```c++
class range_error {};

class vector {
	...
public:
	int &at(size_t i) {
		if (i < n) return theVector[i];
		else throw range_error{};
	}
};
```
Client's options:
1. do nothing
```c++
vector v;
v.push_back(1);
v.at(1); // the exception will crash the program
```
2. catch the exception
```c++
try {
	vector v;
	v.push_back(1);
	v.at(1);
}
catch (rangeError &r) {
	// do something
}
```
3. let your caller catch it
```c++
int f() {
	vector v;
	v.push_back(1);
	v.at(1);
}
int g() {
	try{f();}
	catch (range_error &r) { /* do something */ }
}
```

Exception will <u>propagate</u> back through the call chain until a <u>handler</u> is found.
- This is called <u>unwinding</u> the stack.
- If no handler is found, the program aborts (std::terminate gets called)
- Control resumes after the catch block. (problem code is not retried)

### What happens if a constructor throws an exception?
- object is considered partial constructed
- destructor will not run on partially constructed objects.

E.g.
```c++
class C { ... };
class D {
	C a;
	C b;
	int *c;
public:
	D() {
		c = new int[100];
		...
		if (...) throw something {}; // *
	}
	~D() { delete [] c; }
	}
};

D d;
// at *, the D object is not fully constructed, so ~D() will not run on d.
// however, a and b are fully constructed, so their destructors will run
```

So if a constructor wants to throw, it must clean up after itself.
```c++
class D {
	...
	public:
	D() {
		c = new int [100];
		...
		if (...) {
			delete [] c; // delete the array before throwing
			throw something{};
		}
	}
};
```

### What happens if a destructor throws?
```c++
class myexn{};
class C {
	...
	public:
	~C() noexcept(false) {throw myexn{};}
};

// by default, program aborts immediately
// std::terminate is called
// we must tag it with noexcept(false)
// watch out:

void h() {
	C c1;	// destructor for c1 throws at end of h
}

void g() {
	C c2;	// unwind through g
	h();	// destructor for c2 throws at end of g
};			// there are now 2 unhandled exceptions

void f() {
	try {
		g();
	}
	catch (myexn &ex) {

	}

}
```
As soon as we get more than 1 unhandled exception, termination is guaranteed, std::terminate called.

**Basically, don't let your destructor throw.**

Also note - you can throw any value, not just objects
```c++
void fact(int n) {
	if (n == 1) throw 1;
	try {
		fact(n-1);
	}
	catch (int m) {
		throw(n*m);
	}
}

void main() {
	int n;
	try {
		fact(n);
	}
	catch (int m) {
		cout << m << endl;
	}
}
```
