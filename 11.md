Problem 11: Better Initialization
=================================
Arrays: `int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5}`
Vector: 
```c++
vector<int> v;
v.push_back(1);
...
```
Long sequence of push_backs can be clunky

Goal: Better initialization
```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
	public:
	vector(): ...
	vector(size_t n, T i = T {}): n{n}, cap{n == 0 ? 1 : n}, theVector{new T[cap]} {
		for (size_t j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
			theVector[j] = i;
		}
	}
}
```

Now:
```c++
vector <int> v;		// empty
vector <int> w {5}; // 0 0 0 0 0
vector <int> z {3, 4};	// 4 4 4
```

Note: T{} (default constructor) means 0 if T is a built-in type

**True Array-Style Initialization**
```c++
#include <initializer_list>
template <typename T> class Vector {
	...
	public:

	vector() ... { ... }
	vector(size_t n, T i = T{}) ... { ... }
	vector(std::initializer_list<T> init): n {init.size()}, 
		size_t cap{init.size()}, theVector{new T[cap]} {
		size_t i = 0;
		for (auto &t: init) theVector[i++] = t;
	}
};

vector <int> v {1,2,3,4,5}; // 1 2 3 4 5
vector <int> v;				// empty
vector <int> v {5};			// 5
vector <int> v {3,4};		// 3 4

// the other constructor is not being called.
```
Default constructors take precedence over initializer lists, which take precedence over other constructors.

To get the other constructor to run: use round bracket initialization
```c++
vector <int> v (5);
vector <int> v (3,4);
```

A note on cost: item in a init list are stored in contiguous memory (begin method returns a pointer). So we are using one array to build another, 2 copies in memory.
- Note: initializer_lists are meant to be immutable
- Do not try to modify their contents, and do not use them as standalone data structures

But also note: only one allocation in vector, not several:
- no doubling and reallocating, as there was with a sequence of pushbacks

In general, if you know how big your vector will be, you can save reallocation cost by requesting space upfront.

```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
	public:
	...
	void reserve(size_t newCap) {
		if (cap < newCap) {
			T *newVec = new T[newCap];
			for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) newVec[i] = theVector[i];
			delete [] theVector;
			theVector = newVec;
			cap = newCap;
		}
	}
}
```
Exercise: rewrite vector so that psuh_back uses reserve instead of increaseCap

```c++
vector <int> v;
v.reserve(10);
v.push_back(...);
...
// can do 10 push_backs without needing to reallocate
```
