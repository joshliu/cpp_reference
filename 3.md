Problem 3: Linear Collections and Memory Management
===========================================================

Arrays on the stack, fixed size:
```c++
int a[10]
```
- a on the stack, fixed size.

On the heap:
```c++
int *p = new int[10];
```
- p is a pointer on the stack pointing at the heap.

To delete: delete []p;
Use new with delete. new[...] with delete[]

Mismatching these is undefined behavior.

Problem: What if our array isn't big enough:?
Note: no realloc for new/delete arrays

Use abstraction to solve the problem.

vector.h:
```c++
#ifndef VECTOR_H
#define VECTOR_H
namespace CS246E {

struct vector {
	size_t size, cap;
	int *theVector;
};

const size_t startSize = 1;

vector make_vector();
size_t size(const vector &v);
int &itemAt(const vector &v, size_t i);
void push_back(const vector &v, int x);
void pop_back(const vector &v, int x);
void dispose(vector &v);

}

#endif
```

# Lecture 4, 9/19/17

vector.cc:
```c++
#include "vector.h"

namespace {
void increaseCap(CS246E::Vector &v) {
	if (v.size == v.cap) {
		int *newVec = new int[2*v.cap];
		for (size_t i = 0; i < v.cap; ++i) newVec[i] = v.theVector[i];
		delete [] v.theVector;
		v.theVector = newVec;
		v.cap *= 2;
	}
}
}

CS246E::Vector CS246E::make_vector() {
	Vector v {0, startSize, new int[startSize]};
	return v;
}

size_t CS246E::size(const Vector &v) { return v.size; }

int &CS246E::itemAt(const Vector &v, size_t i) { return v.theVector[i]; }

void CS246E::push_back(Vector &v, int n) {
	increaseCap(v);
	v.theVector[v.size++] = n;
}

void CS246E::pop_back(Vector &v, int n) {
	if (v.size > 0) --v.size;
}

void CS246E::dispose(Vector &v) {
	delete v.theVector;
}
```

### Reading: Section 7.7.1, Chapter 14, 16.2

main.cc:
```c++
#include "vector.h"
using CS246E::vector;

int main () {
	vector v = CS246E::make_vector();
	push_back(v,1);
	push_back(v,10);
	push_back(v,100);
	itemAt(v,0) = 2;

	dispose(v);
}
```

Question: Why don't we have to say CS246E::push_back, CS246E::itemAt, CS246E::dispose?
Answer: Argument Dependent Lookup (ADL) - also called k√∂nig lookup.
- If the type of a function f's argument belongs to a namespace n, then C++ will search the namespace n, as well as the current scope, for a function matching f.
- This is the reason why we can say "std::cout << x" instead of "std::operator <<(std::cout, x)"

Problems:
What if we forget to call make_vector?
- We have an unitialized object.

What if we forget to call dispose?
- Memory leak.

#### How can we make this more robust?

# Introduction to Classes
First concept in OOP - functions inside of structs.

```c++
struct Student {
	int assns, mt, final;
	float grade() { return assns*0.4 + mt*0.2 + final*0.4 }
};

```

Structs that can contain functions are what we call classes.
Functions inside structs are called <b>methods</b>.
Instances of a class are called <b>objects</b>.

```c++
Student bob {90, 70, 80};

cout << bob.grade();
```

What do assins, mt, final mean within grade() { ... } ?
- fields of the current object- the receiver of the method call, e.g. bob

Formally: methods differ from functions in that methods have an implicit param called <u>this</u> that is a pointer to the receiver object.

```c++
bob.grade() // this == &bob
```

Could have written (equivalent):
```c++
struct Student {
	float grade() {
		return 	this->assns * 0.4
			+	this->mt * 0.2
			+	this->final * 0.4;
	}
};
```

### Initializing Objects
```c++
Student bob {90,70,80}; // C-style struct initialization, field by field, ok but limited

// Better: initialization method - a constructor.
struct Student {
	int assns, mt, final;

	Student(int assns, int mt, int final) {
		this->assns = assns; // using this->assns bc they have the same name, but if different u dont need arrows
		this->mt = mt;
		this->final = final;
	}

};

// Now can use:
Student bob {90,70,80}; // Now calls the constructor function with args 90,70,80.
```

Note: once a constructor function is defined, C-style field by field initialization is no longer available.

Equiv:
```c++
Student bob = Student {90,70,80};

// Heap:
Student *p = new Student {90,70,80};
delete p;
```

Advantages of constructors: default parameters, overloading, sanity checks
e.g.

Default Values:
```c++
struct Student {
	student(int assns = 0, int mt = 0, int final = 0) {
		this->assns = assns;
	}
};

Student laura {70}; // 70, 0, 0
Student newKid; 	// 0, 0, 0
```

Note:
Every class comes with a built in default constructor. (i.e. zero argument constructor)

e.g.
```c++
Node n; // calls default constructor. default-constructs all fields that are objects. 
		// (does nothing in this case)
```
- Goes away if you write any constructor at all.

e.g.
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	Node (int data, Node *next = nullptr) {

	}
};

Node n{3};	// works
Node n; 	// can't do this, no default constructor.
```

Object creation protocol
- When an object is created, there are 4 steps:
	1. Space is allocated
	2. (later)
	3. Fields constructed in declaration order (field constructors called for fields that are objects)
	4. Constructor body runs.

Field initialization should happen in step 3, but constructor body is step 4.

Consequence: object fields initialized twice.
```c++
include <string>

struct Student {
	int assns, mt, final;
	std::string name;

	Student(std::string name, int assns, int mt, int final) {
		this->name = name;
		...
	}
};

Student mike {"Mike", 90, 70, 80};
// name default initialized in step 3 ("")
// reassigned in step 4 ("Mike")
```

To fix: the Member Initialization List (MIL)
```c++
struct Student {
	...
	Student (std::string name, int assns, int mt, int final):	// field{param}
		name{name}, assns{assns}, mt{mt}, final{final}			// step 3
		{}														// step 4
}
```

# Tutorial 2, 9/20/17

Note
- MIL must be used for fields that are constants, references, objects without default constructor
- Should be used as much as possible

Careful: single argument constructors:
```c++
struct Node {
	Node(int data, Node *next = nullptr) : {}
}

// single argument constructors create implicit conversions.

Node n{4}; 	// OK
Node n = 4; // Also OK

void f(Node n);
f(4); 		// OK - may be trouble

// implicit conversion from int to Node
```
Explicit:
```c++
// To fix, add word explicit to constructor to disable implicit conversion

struct Node {
	explicit Node(int data, Node *next = nullptr): {

	}
}

Node n{4};	// OK
Node n = 4;	// NO
f(4);		// NO
f(Node{4});	// OK
```

### Object Destruction:
- A method called the destructor runs automatically
- Built in destructor: calls destructor on all fields that are objects


Object Destruction Protocol:
1. Destructor body runs
2. Fields destructed (destructor called on fields that are objects) in reverse declaration order
3. (later)
4. Space is deallocated.

```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
};

// what does the built in destructor do?
// Nothing - neither field is an object.

Node *n = new Node{3, new Node{4, new Node{5, nullptr}}};
delete n; // only deletes the first node

```

Writing our own destructor:
```c++
struct Node {
	~Node() {
		delete next;
	}
}

delete n; // now frees the whole list
```

Also:
```c++
{
	Node n {1, new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};
	// n is stack allocated, other nodes are heap allocated.
}	// Scope of n ends; whole list is freed.
```

### Objects:
- a constructor always runs when they are created
- a destructor always runs when they are destroyed.

### Back to the vector example - lets turn it into a class.
vector.h:
```c++
#ifndef VECTOR_H
#define VECTOR_H

namespace CS246E {
struct Vector {
	size.t n, cap;
	int *theVector;
	Vector();
	size_t size();
	int &itemAt(size_t i);
	void push_back(int n);
	void pop_back();
	~vector();
};
}
#endif
```

vector.cc:
```c++
#include "vector.h"

namespace {
void increaseCap(Vector &v) {

}
}
const size_t startSize = 1;
CS246E::Vector::Vector() : size{0}, cap{startSize}, theVector{new int[cap]} {}
size_t CS246E::Vector::size() {return n;}

// etc...

CS246E::Vector::~Vector() {
	delete [] theVector;
}

```

main.cc:
```c++
int main() {
	Vector v; // constructor automatically called - no make_vector
	v.push_back(1);
	v.push_back(10);
	v.push_back(100);
	v.itemAt(0) = 2;

}	// no dispose, destructor cleans v up.
```
