# Problem 19 - I'm Leaking!
Consider:
```c++
class X {
	int *a;
public:
	X (int n): a{new int[n]} {}
	~X() { delete [] a }
};

class Y: public X {
	int *b;
public:
	Y(int n, int m): X{n}, b{new int[m]} {}
	~Y() {delete [] b;}
};

// Note: Y's destructor will call X's destructor (Step 3)

X *px = new Y{3,4};
delete px; // Leaks.
```

Calls X's destructor, but not Y's.
Solution - make the destructor virtual.
```c++
class X {
	...
public:
	...
	virtual ~X() {delete [] a;}
}
```
- No more leak.

Always make the destructor virtual in classes that are meant to be superclasses. Even if the destructor does nothing, you never know what the subclass might do, so you need to make sure its destructor gets called.

If a class is not meant to be a superclass- no need to incur the cost of virtual methods.
- leave the destructor non-virtual.

```
class X final { // cannot be subclassed.
	...
};
```
