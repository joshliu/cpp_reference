# Problem 19 - I'm Leaking!
Consider:
```c++
class X {
	int *a;
public:
	X (int n): a{new int[n]} {}
	~X() { delete [] a }
};

class Y: public X {
	int *b;
public:
	Y(int n, int m): X{n}, b{new int[m]} {}
	~Y() {delete [] b;}
};

// Note: Y's destructor will call X's destructor (Step 3)

X *px = new Y{3,4};
delete px; // Leaks. X's destructor was called.
```
