+------------+      +-------+
|-VIN:Integer|
+------------+
owns-a relationship (composition)
- means the motor is part of the car
	- does not have an independent existence
	- copy/destroy the car => copy/destroy the motor (deep copies)
- typical implementation - class composition, i.e. object fields

e.g.
class Car {Motor m;};


+----------+  0..*+-------+
|Pond      |⬦---->|Duck   |
+----------+      +-------+
has-a relationship (aggregation)
- duck has its own independent existence
- copy/destroy the pond !=> copy/destroy the ducks
- typical implementation - pointer field

e.g.
class Pond {vector <Duck*> ducks;};
```
- The concept of ownership is central to Object Oriented design in C++
- Every resource (memory, file, window, etc.) should be owned by an object that will release it - RAII
- A unique_ptr owns the memory it points to.
- A raw pointer should be regarded as not owning the memory it points to.
- If you need to point at the same object with several pointers, one pointer should own it and be a unique ptr. The rest should be raw pointers. Moving a unique_ptr = transferring ownership
- If you need true shared ownership - later


## Measures of Design Quality
- Coupling and Cohesion
- Coupling - how many different modules depend on each other
	- low to high:
		- function calls with params/results of basic type
		- function clals with array/struct params
		- modules affect each other's control flow
		- modules sharing global data
		- modules access each other's implementation (friends)
- Cohesion - how closely are elements of a module related to each other
	- low to high:
		- arbitrary grouping (e.g. utility library)
		- common theme, otherwise unrelated, maybe some common base code (e.g. algorithm)
		- elements manipulate state over the lifetime of an object (e.g. open/read/close files)
		- elements pass data to each other
		- elements cooperate to perform exactly one task

High coupling - changes to a module affect other modules
- harder to reuse individual modules

E.g. function whatIsIt(dynamic_cast) - tightly coupled to the Book hierarchy, must change this function if you create another Book subclass

low cohesion => poorly organized code - hard to understand, maintain
Want high cohesion, low coupling.

## SOLID Principles of OO Design

### 1: Single Responsibility Principle
- a class should only have one reason to change
	- i.e. a class should do one thing, not several
- Any change to the problem spec require a change to the program
- If changes to >= 2 different parts of the spec cause changes to the same class, SRP is violated.
E.g. Don't let your (main) classes print things

Consider:
```c++
class Chessboard{
	...
	cout << "Your move";
	...
};
```
- Bad design, inhibits code reuse.

What if you want a version of your program that:
- Communicates over different streams (file/network)?
- Works in another language?
- Uses graphics instead of text?

- Major changes to Chessboard class, instead of reuse. Violates SRP.
	- must change the class if there is any change to the specificatino for:
		- game rules
		- strategy
		- interface
		- etc.
	- low cohesion situation, should split these up.
		- one module responsible for communication
		- if a class wants to say something - do it via params, results, exceptions
			- pass info to communications object and let it do the talking
	- On the other hand - specificaitons that are unlikely to change may not need their own class, avoid needless complexity. Judgement call.

### 2: Open/Closed Principle
- Classes, Modules, Functions, etc. should be open for extension, and closed for modification
- Changes in a program's behaviour should happen by writing new code- not by changing old code.
```
+------------+      +---------+
|Carpenter   |⬦---->|HandSaw  |
+------------+      +---------+
```
What if the carpenter buys a tablesaw?
- this design is not open for extension, have to change the carpenter code.

Solution: Abstraction
```
+------------+      +---------+
|Carpenter   |⬦---->|/Saw/    |
+------------+      +---------+
                         ^
                         |
               Handsaw --+-- Tablesaw
```

Also note:
```c++
int countHeavy(const vector<Book*> &v) {
	int count = 0;
	for (auto &p:v) if (p->isHeavy()) ++count;
	return count;
}
```

Note: can't really be 100% closed. Same chanes may require source modification.
Plan for the most likely changes and make your code closed with respect to those changes.

### 3: Liskov Substitution Principle
- Simply put: public inheritance must indicate an Is-A relationship.
- But there smore to it:
	- If B is a subtype (subclass) of A, then we should be able to make an object b of type B in any context that requires an object of type A, without affecting the correctness of the program.
- C++'s inheritance rules already allow us to use subclass objects in place of superclass objects.
- \* - this is the important point.
- Informally, the program should "not be able to tell" if it is using a superclass object or a subclass object.

Formally: If an invariant I is true of class A, then it must be true of class B.
If an invariant I is true of method A::f, and B::f overrides A::f, then I must hold for B::f.
If A::f has a precondition P and a postcondition Q, then B::f must have a precondition P'<= P, and a postcondition Q' => Q.

If A::f and B::f behave differently, the difference in behavior must fall within what is allowed by the program's correctness specification.

Examples:
1. Contravariance Problem
	- Arises any time you have a binary operator, i.e. a method with an other parameter of the same type as \*this.
	- Violates Liskov Substitution.
		- A circle is a shape
		- A shape can be compared with any other shape.
		- Therefore Circle can be compared with any other shape.
		- We saw this with virtual operator=
		- C++ will flag this problem iwtha compiler error.

```
    Shape
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
Circle  Square
```

```c++
class Shape {
	public:
	virtual bool operator==(const shape &other) const;
};

class Circle: public Shape {
	public:
	bool operator==(const Shape &other) const override;
};
```
	
Fix:
```c++
#include <typeinfo>
bool Circle::operator==(const Shape &other) const {
	if (typeid(other) != typeid(Circle)) return false;
	const Circle &cother = static_cast <const Circle &> (other);
	// compare fields of other with fields of *this.
}
```

#### dynamic_cast vs typeid:
`dynamic_cast <Circle &> (other);`
	- is other a Circle or a subclass of Circle
`typeid(other) == typeid(Circle)`
	- is other precisely a circle?
	- typeid returns an object of type typeinfo.

Is square a rectangle?
- a square has all the properties of a rectangle.

```c++
class Rectangle {
	int length, width;
	public:
	Rectangle(...);
	int getLength() const; 
	virtual void setLength(int);
	int getWidth() const;
	virtual void setWidth(int);
	int area() const{ return length * width; }
};

class Square: public Rectangle {
	public:
	Square(int side): Rectangle (side, side) {}
	void setLength(int l) override {
		Rectangle::setLength(l);
		Rectangle::setWidth(l);
	}
	void setWidth(int w); //similar.
}

int f(Rectangle &r) {
	r.setLength(10);
	r.setWidth(20);
	return r.area(); // expect 200
}

Sqaure s {1};
f(s); // 400
```

Rectangles have the property that their length and width can vary independently; Squares don't have that property.
- Therefore, this violates LSP.
- On the other hand, an immutable square could substitute for an immutable Rectangle.

```

       +----+-----+

```
- Constraining what subclasses can do

Consider:
```c++
class Turtle {
	public:
	virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
	public:
	void draw() override {
		drawHead(); drawRedShell(); drawFeet();
	}
};

class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
	public:
	void draw() override {
		drawHead(); drawGreenShell(), drawFeet();
	}
}
```
- code duplication
- Plus - how can we ensure that overrides of draw will always do these things?

```
class Turtle {
	public:
	void draw() {
		drawHead();
		drawShell();
		drawFeet();
	}
	private:
	void drawHead();
	virtual void drawShell() = 0;
	void drawFeet();
};

class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
	void drawShell() override;
};

class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
	void drawShell() override;
};
```

Subclasses cannot control the steps of drawing a turtle, nor the drawing of head + feet.
Can only control the drawing of a Shell - called the **Template Method Pattern**.

Extension - **Non-virtual Interface** (NVI) idiom
- public virtual methods are simultaneously: 
	- part of a class's interface - pre/post conditions, respect invariatnes
	- "hooks" for customization by subclasses - overriding code could be anything

NVI says: all virtual methods should be private, i.e. all public methods should be non-virtual.
Eg.
```c++
class DigitalMedia {
	public:
	virtual void play() = 0;
};

// should be

class DigitalMedia {
	public:
	void play() {
		doPlay();
	}
	private:
	virtual void doPlay() = 0;
};
```
- generalizes template method pattern
- puts every virtual function inside a template method.

### 4: Interface Segregation Principle
Many small interfaces is better than one large interface.
- If a class has many functionalities, each client of the class should only see the functionality it needs. 

Eg. video game
```c++
class Enemy {
	public:
	virtual void strike();	// needed by game logic
	virtual void draw();	// needed by user interface
};

class UI {
	vector<Enemy*> v;
};

class Battlefield {
	vector<Enemy*> v;
};
```
If we need to chang ethe drawing interface, Battlefield must recompile for no reason.

Creates needless coupling between UI and Battlefield.

One solution: Multiple Inheritance
```c++
class Draw {
	public:
	virtual void draw() = 0;
};

class Combat {
	public:
	virtual void strike() = 0;
};

class Enemy: public Draw, public Combat {};

class UI {
	vector <Draw *> v;
};

class Battlefield {
	vector <Combat *> v;
};
```
Example of the Adapter Pattern
General use of Adapter - when a class provides an interface different from the one you need:
```
Eg.

+----------------+   +----------------+
|Needed Interface|   |Provided Class  |
+----------------+   +----------------+
|+g()            |   |+f()            |
+----------------+   +----------------+
        ^                     ^
        |                     |
        +----------+----------+
                   |
            +--------------+
            |Adapter       |
            +--------------+  +--------------+
            |+g()----------|--|{f();}        |
            +--------------+  +--------------+

```
Detour: issues with Multiple Inheritance
```
+------+    +------+
|A1    |    |A2    |
+------+    +------+
|+a()  |    |+a()  |
+------+    +------+
    ^         ^
    |         |
    +----+----+
         |
       +---+
       |B  |
       +---+ - has 2 a() methods

       +---+
       |A  |
       +---+
         ^
         |
    +----+-----+
    |          |
 +---+        +---+
 |B  |        |C  |
 +---+        +---+
    ^          ^
    |          |
    +----+-----+
         |
       +---+ - has 2 a() methods, and they're different.
       |D  |
       +---+
```

```c++
class D: public B, public C {
	void f() {... a() ...}
};

D d;
d.a(); // use d.B::a() or d.C::a()
```

OR,

Maybe there should only be one A base, and therefore only one a().

```c++
class B: virtual public A {...};
class C: virtual public A {...};
d.a() - no longer ambiguous
```

Eg. iostream hierarchy
```
       ios_base
          |
         ios
       v/   \v
  istream   ostream
        \   /
       iostream
        /    \
  fstream    stringstream
```

Problem- How will a class like D be laid out in memory? (implementation specific)

Consider:
```
+---------+ <--- should look like an A*, B*, C*, D*, but doesn't look like a C*.
|vptr     |
+---------+
|A fields |
+---------+
|B fields |
+---------+
|C fields |
+---------+
|D fields |
+---------+

but g++ gives us:

+---------+ <--- D*, B*(?)
|vptr     |
+---------+
|B fields |
+---------+ <--- C*(?)
|vptr     |
+---------+
|C fields |
+---------+
|D fields |
+---------+ <--- A*
|vptr     |
+---------+
|A fields |
+---------+
```
- B and C need to be laid out so that we can find the A part, but the distance is not known (depends on the run-time type of the object)
- **Solution:** location of base object stored in vtable.
- Also note - diagram doesn't simultaneously look like A,B,C,D, but slices of it do.
Therefore pointer assignment among A,B,C,D ptrs  may change the address stored in the pointer.

```c++
D *d = ...;
A *a = d; // changes the address.
```
- static_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast under Multiple Inheritance will also adjust the value of the pointer.
- reinterpret_cast will not.

### 5: Dependency Inversion Principle
- High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction.
- Abstract classes should never depend on concrete classes.

Traditional top-down design:
```
+------------------+         +----------------+
|High-level module |-------->|Low-level module|
+------------------+         +----------------+

e.g.
+------------------+         +----------------+
|Word Count        |-------->|Keyboard Reader |
+------------------+         +----------------+
- what if I want to use a file reader?
- changes to details affect the higher level word count module.
```

Dependency inversion:
```
+------------------+         +---------------------+
|High-level module |-------->|Low-level Abstraction|
+------------------+         +---------------------+
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        |
                             +---------------------+
                             |Low-level module     |
                             +---------------------+

+------------------+         +---------------------+
|WordCount         |-------->|/Input Interface/    |
+------------------+         +---------------------+
                                        ^
                                        |
                                 +------+------+
                                 |             |
                        +------------+      +----------+
                        |Keyboard    |      |File      |
                        |Reader      |      |Reader    |
                        +------------+      +----------+
```

Works over several layers as well.
```
high -> medium -> low

=>

high -> medInterface
             ^
             |
           medium -> lowInterface
                          ^
                          |
                         low
```

eg.
```
timer⬦---->bell
           +notify()

when the timer hits some specified time, it rings the bell.
(calls Bell::notify, which rings the bell)

What if we want the timer to trigger other events?

timer⬦---->/responder/
           +notify()
                ^
                |
          +-----+------+
          |            |
        Bell         Lights
        +notify()    +notify()
```

Maybe we want a dynamic set of responders:
```
+---------------------+        +-------------+
|Timer                |⬦------>|Responder    |
+---------------------+        +-------------+
|+register(Responder) |<------⬦|+notify()    |
|+unregister(Responder)        +-------------+
+---------------------+               ^
                                      |
                                +-----+------+
                                |            |
                               Bell         Light

Now Responder is depending on the concrete timer class, apply dependency inversion again.
                              *
/Source/⬦--------------------->/Responder/
+register(Responder)           +notify()
+unregister(Responder)             ^
    ^                              |
    |                        +-----+------+
    |                        |            |
Timer()<------------------⬦Bell     +--⬦Light
    ^                               |
    +-------------------------------+

If Bell/Light's behavior depends on the time, 
may need to depend on the concrete timer for a getTime method.
- could dependency invert this again, if you wanted.

General Solution: known as the Observer Pattern.
+----------------+             +----------------+ 
|/Subject/       |             |/Observer/      |
+----------------+⬦----------->+----------------+ 
|+notifyObservers|             |+notify()       |
|+attatch(Obs)   |             +----------------+ 
|+detatch(Obs)   |                      ^
+----------------+                      |
        ^                               |
        |                               |
+----------------+             +-----------------+
|ConcreteSubject |             |Concrete Observer|
+----------------+<-----------⬦+-----------------+
|+getState()     |             |+notify()        |
+----------------+             +-----------------+
```

Sequence of Calls:
1. Subject's state changes
2. `Subject::notifyObservers(either by the Subject itself or an external controller)`
	- calls each observer's `notify()`
3. Each observer calls concreteSubject::getState to query the state and react accordingly

# Some more design patterns

**Factory Method Pattern** - when you don't know exactly what kind of object you want, and your preferences may vary.
- also called the virtual constructor pattern
- strategy pattern applied to object construction.

```
        +-----------+
        |/Enemy/    |
        +-----------+
              ^
              |
        +-----+-----+
        |           |
    +-------+    +-------+
    |Turtle |    |Bullet |
    +-------+    +-------+

- randomly generated
- more turtles in easy levels
- more bullets in hard levels

        +-----------+
        |/Level/    |
        +-----------+
              ^

    |Easy   |    |Hard   |
    +-------+    +-------+

class Level {
	public:
	virtual Enemy* getEnemy() = 0;
};

class Easy: public Level {
	public:
	Enemy *getEnemy() override {
		// mostly turtles
	}
};

class Hard: public Level {
	public:
	Enemy *getEnemy() override {
		// mostly bullets
	}
};

Level *l = new Easy;
Enemy *e = l->getEnemy();
```

Decorator Pattern - add/remove functionality to/from objects at runtime
eg. add menus/scrollbars to windows - either or both
- without a combinatorial explosion of subclasses.

```
             +-------------+
             |/Component/  |

Every Decorator IS a component and HAS a component.
- window w/ scrollbar is a kind of window, and has a pointer to the underlying plain window.
- window w/ scrollbar and menu is a window and has a pointer to a window w/ scrollbar, which as a pointer to a plain window.

Eg.
```c++
WindowInterface *w = new WindowWithMenu {
	new WindowWithScrollbar {
		new Window {}}};
```

### Visitor Pattern
- for implementing **double dispatch**
	- method chosen based on the runtime of 2 objects

```
        +-----------+
        |/Enemy/    |
        +-----------+
              ^
              |
        +-----+-----+
        |           |
    +-------+    +-------+
    |Turtle |    |Bullet |
    +-------+    +-------+



        +-----------+
        |/Weapon/   |
        +-----------+
              ^
              |
        +-----+-----+
        |           |
    +-------+    +-------+
    |Stick  |    |Rock   |
    +-------+    +-------+
```
- The effect of striking an enemy with a weapon depends on both the enemy and the weapon.
- C++ virtual methods are dispatched on the type of the receiver object, and not method params. No way to specify two receiver objects.

Visitor - two-stage dispatch, combining overriding with overloading.
```c++
class Enemy {
	public:
	virtual void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) = 0;
};

class Turtle: public Enemy {
	public:
	void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) override {w.strike(*this);}
};

class Bullet: public Enemy {
	public:
	void beStruckBy(Weapon &w) override {w.strike(*this);}
};

class Weapon {
	public:
	virtual void strike(Turtle &t) = 0;
	virtual void strike(Bullet &b) = 0;
};

class Stick: public Weapon {
	public:
	void strike(Turtle &t) override {
		//strike turtle with stick
	}

	void strike(Bullet &b) override {
		//strike bullet with stick
	}
}
```

```c++
Enemy *e = new Bullet{...};
Weapon *e = new Rock{...};
e->beStruckBy(*w); 

// What happens?
// Bullet::beStruckBy runs (virt. method dispatch)
// which calls Weapon::strike(Bullet &b) since *this is a Bullet
// this fact is known at compile time, overload resolution

// virtual method resolves to Rock::Strike(Bullet &)
```

Visitor can also be used to add functionality to a class hierarchy without adding new virtual methods.

Add a visitor to the book hierarchy:
```c++
class Book {
	...
	public:
	...
	virtual void accept(BookVisitor &v) {v.visit(*this);}
};

class Text: public Book {
	...
	public:
	void accept(BookVisitor &v) override {
		v.visit(*this);
	}
};

class BookVisitor {
	public:
	virtual void visit(Book &b) = 0;
	virtual void visit(Text &t) = 0;
	virtual void visit(Comic &c) = 0;
};
```

Example: Categorize and Count.
- For Books: - by Author
- Texts: - by Topic
- Comics: - by Hero

Could do this with a virtual method, or write a visitor.
```c++
class Catalog: public BookVisitor {
	public:
	map<string, int> theCat;
	void visit(Book &b) override {++theCat[b.getAuthor()];}
	void visit(Text &t) override {++theCat[b.getTopic()];}
	void visit(Comic &c) override {++theCat[c.getHero()];}
};
```

### But it won't compile!
- Circular include dependency
- book.h, BookVisitor.h include each other.
- include guard prevents multiple inclusion
- whichever ends up occurring first will refer to things not yet defined.
- needless includes create artificial compilation dependencies, and slow down compilation, or prevent compilation altogether.

Sometimes a forward class declaration is not good enough.

Consider:
```c++
class A {...}; // A.h

class B {
	A a;
};

class C {
	A *a;
};

class D: public A {
	...
};

class E {
	A f(A);
};

class F {
	A f(A a) {a. someMethod();}
};

class G {
	t<A> x;
};
```
Which need includes? B,D,F need includes

C,E forward declare ok.

G - it depends on how the template t uses A.
- should collapse to one of the other cases.

Note: class F only needs an include because method f's implementation is present.
- a good resason to keep implementation in .cc
- where possible: forward declare in .h, include in .cc

Also notice: B needs an include; C does not.
- If we want to break the compilation dependency of B on A, we could make B like C.

More generally:
```c++
class A1{}; class A2{}; class A3{};

class B {
	A1 a1;
	A2 a2;
	A3 a3;
};
```

b.h:
```c++
class BImpl;

class B {
	unique_ptr<BImpl> pImpl;
};
```

bimpl.h:
```c++
#include "a1.h"
...

struct BImpl {
	A1 a1;
	A2 a2;
	A3 a3;
};
```

b.cc:
```c++
#include "b.h"
#include "bimpl.h"

methods reference pImpl -> a1, a2, a3
```

b.h no longer compilation-dependent on a1.h, etc.
- called the pImpl idiom.

Another advantage of pImpl - pointers have a non-throwing swap.

Can provide the strong guarantee on a B method by
- copying the Impl into a new BImpl structure (heap-allocated)
- method modifies the copy
- if anything throws, discard the new structure (easy and automatic with unique_ptrs)
- if all succeeds swap impl structs (ptrswap - nothrow)
- previous impl automcatically destroyed by the smartptr.

Example:
```c++
class B {
	unique_ptr<BImpl> pImpl;
	...
	void f() {
		auto temp = make_unique<BImpl>(*pImpl);
		temp->doSomething();
		temp->doSomethingElse();
		std::swap(pImpl,temp); // nothrow
	} // strong guarantee
};
```
