Problem 6: I want a constant vector
===================================

Say we want to print a vector:
```c++
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, const vector &v) {
	for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) 
		out << v.itemAt[i] << " ";
	return out;
}

int main() {
	vector v;
	...
	cout << v;
}
```
- This wont compile.
	- can't call size and itemAt on a const object.
	- what if these methods change fields?
	- since they don't, it should be safe to use them, but the compiler doesn't know that

You must declare methods to be const.

vector.h:
```c++
struct vector {
	...

	size_t size() const;
	int &itemAt(size_t i) const; 
	// Means these methods will not modify fields
	// Can be called on const objects
};
```

vector.cc:
```c++

size_t vector::size() const { return n; }
int &vector::itemAt(size_t i) const { return theVector[i]; }
```

Now the loop will work.
But:

```c++
void f(const vector &v) {
	v.itemAt(0) = 4; // Works, but v is not very const.
}
```
- v is a const object, cannot change n, cap, theVector (pointer)
	- but we can change items pointed to by theVector.

Can we fix this?
```c++
struct vector {
	...
	const int &itemAt(size_t i) const;
};

const int vector::&itemAt(size_t i) const { return theVector[i]; }
```

Now v.itemAt(0) = 4 won't compile if v is const. But it also won't compile if v is not const.

To fix this: <u>const overloading</u>
```c++
struct vector {
	...
	const int &itemAt(size_t i) const;	// will be called if object is const
	int &itemAt(size_t i);				// will be called if object not const
};

inline const int vector::&itemAt(size_t i) const {return theVector[i];}
inline int vector::&itemAt(size_t i) {return theVector[i];}

// suggests replacing the func call with func body - save cost of func call.
// do this in the header.
```
v.itemAt(0) = 4 will compile if and only if v is non-const.

Now lets make it prettier:

vector.h:
```c++
struct vector {
	...
	size_t size() const { return n; }
	const int &operator[](size_t i) const { return theVector[i]; }
	int &operator[](size_t i) { return theVector[i]; }
	// if you put the method body in the class, implicitly declares method is inline.
};
```

Back to the start:
```c++
ostream &operator<<(ostream &out, vector v) {
	for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
		out << v[i] << " ";
	}
	return out;
}
```
